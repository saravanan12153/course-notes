# Week 9 Lab: This is the end. My only friend, the end.

For this final assignment, we're going to have multiple parts:

* Bug reports from Jacuqes on your API you've been working on this week. Warning: He's a picky Francophile.
* A set of common developer technical interview questions - intended to be completed sans Google (just like you would be in an interview)
* A deck of some sort - using Keynote if you have it or [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) if you don't (and don't want to spend $20 on Keynote) - that walks through your final project idea for presentation on Monday. Even if you intend to do a team project, you still need to pitch.

As a final note, I'd like to thank you all for being an awesome group of students and fantastic first cohort for here in Indianapolis. I can't wait to see where your final projects - and your careers - take you.

## Requirements

* Fix Jacques' bugs. Close the issues using your commit messages.
* Make yourself an issue as per usual and comment on that issue with a gist to your solutions on the interview questions. REMEMBER: NO GOOGLE. "I'm not sure" is a totally valid answer.
* A deck and an idea for Monday.

#### Interview questions

1. Sum an array of numbers
2. Implement your own version of Enumerable#collect
3. Write a function that finds all the duplicate words in an abritrary amount of text
4. Do FizzBuzz: "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."
5. What's the difference between a class and a module?

##### Nightmare Mode

I had this as an interview question for a senior position a while back. If you're feeling froggy, feel free to give it a shot.

This is _exactly_ as it was given to me.

Of note: This was a "take home" question. So, Google's back on.

```
Please complete a set of classes for the problem described in this blog post: http://www.adomokos.com/2012/10/the-organizations-users-roles-kata.html. You shouldn't create a DB backend for this, plain Ruby objects should work fine.  Please make sure the code can be checked out and any test or examples run without errors.

Make your solution available to us in some way, shape, or form. If you could create a GitHub repository that would be fantastic.
